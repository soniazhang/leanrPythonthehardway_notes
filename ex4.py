# use good names for variables
cars = 100;  ## like R
print "there are", cars, "cars available." ## like Octave
average_passengers_per_car=30 ## the_is called an underscore character. We use this character a lot to put an imaginary space between words in variable names.
print "We need to put about", average_passengers_per_car, "in each car." ## only when we print it, then it will show on the screen
